I built a two-dimensional Lattice Boltzmann solver from the ground up, embedding an Immersed Boundary Method to simulate insect flight. My focus was the clap-and-fling maneuver—where insect wings press together and fling apart to generate lift. To capture this motion, I combined Lagrangian interface tracking with a diffuse interface capturing approach. The result was a framework that could resolve leading-edge vortices and the delayed stall that nature exploits so effectively."

The goal was to handle realistic interfaces and capture sharp features. I embedded this into an in-house code."

        {
            "heading": "",
            "content": "In the world of energetic materials—substances like HMX, RDX, or TATB—failure isn’t an option. These materials must endure shocks, store energy safely, and release it on command. But understanding how they behave under extreme conditions is far from simple. The challenge lies not just in the chemistry, or the physics, or the structure—but in how all of these interact across scales.My work over the past few years has focused on exactly that: building computational models that connect the microscopic structure of a material to its macroscopic performance. And increasingly, that work has been driven not just by equations, but by data."
        },
        {
            "heading": "From Microstructure to Macroscale",
            "content": "Energetic materials are typically heterogeneous—they contain crystals, binders, and defects at the microscale. When a shock hits, it doesn’t trigger a uniform response. Instead, energy gets localized in small “hotspot” zones, often around voids or cracks. These hotspots can grow, interact, and eventually trigger a detonation. Predicting when and how that transition happens is a central question in shock physics.To answer it, we adopted a multi-scale modeling strategy: start at the microstructure, simulate how it behaves under shock, and then use those results to inform larger-scale models. This process demands high-resolution simulations of many different microstructures, each with varying void geometries, distributions, and loading conditions.But such simulations are expensive—running a single Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of shock response can take dozens of hours on a high-performance computing cluster. That’s where machine learning enters the picture."

        {
            "heading": "Generative AI for Synthetic Microstructures",
            "content": "One of the first steps we took was to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create synthetic microstructures. Real microstructure images, especially of sensitive energetic materials, are hard to access. By training GANs on a limited dataset of SEM images, we were able to generate realistic substitutes—structures with controllable features like crystal size, shape, orientation, and void distribution.These synthetic structures were then used in DNS to evaluate energy localization rates. The results closely matched those from real images. This showed that data-driven generation could extend our reach without sacrificing fidelity—a step toward Materials by Design."
        },
        {
            "heading": "From Simulation to Surrogate",
            "content": "Simulating microstructures is one thing. Making predictions from them is another. To link microstructure features to energy deposition, we developed surrogate models—starting with a Modified Bayesian Kriging (MBKG) framework. This became the MES-IG model, a data-driven ignition-and-growth formulation that could replace DNS in macro-scale simulations.Later, we developed the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional (PARC) Neural Network, in collaboration with the University of Virginia. PARC goes further than regression—it learns the thermo-mechanical evolution of hotspots over time, directly from simulation data. Trained on ensembles of DNS runs, it delivers near-DNS accuracy in milliseconds.What makes PARC particularly exciting is its interpretability. It can visualize learned features and identify critical morphological traits—essentially telling us what kind of voids are most dangerous. In doing so, it moves beyond prediction to understanding."
        },
        {
            "heading": "Toward a Predictive Science of Detonation",
            "content": "These models—MES-IG, PARC, and later MISSEL (a semi-analytical closure)—now form the backbone of our surrogate-informed multi-scale framework. Each addresses the scale-bridging challenge from a different angle: low-dimensional regression, deep learning assimilation, and physics-based closure.Together, they enable predictive simulations that are faster, more generalizable, and grounded in both physics and data. This approach doesn’t just accelerate computations—it reshapes how we think about material modeling.By combining simulation, statistical learning, and physics constraints, we can now explore vast microstructural design spaces, assess uncertainty, and generate performance maps—tools that are vital not just for understanding, but for engineering safer and smarter energetic materials."
