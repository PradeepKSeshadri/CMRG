    "title": "About Research Group",
    "description": "The Computational Multiphysics Research Group (CoMPhys Lab) focuses on developing advanced computational models to study complex thermomechanical systems involving moving boundaries, multiphase interactions, and high strain-rate physics. Our research spans a broad range of applicationsâ€”from bioinspired flight and cardiovascular flows to droplet evaporation, energetic material dynamics, and hypersonic reentry physics."
  },
    "description1": "At the core of our work lies a rigorous blend of first-principles modeling, high-fidelity numerical methods, and AI-accelerated multi-scale simulations. We seek to uncover governing physical mechanisms, design predictive frameworks, and provide insights into real-world engineering problems in aerospace, defense, energy, and biological systems.",
    "description2": "We actively collaborate across disciplines and welcome students and researchers eager to challenge themselves, develop meaningful tools, and contribute to high-impact science and engineering. The lab emphasizes research integrity, team learning, and best practices in software development, preparing members for both academic and industry leadership roles.",
